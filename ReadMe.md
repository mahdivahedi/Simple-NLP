Impact of Lambda and Epsilon on the accuracy;  
Decreasing the Lambda and Epsilon causes the augment of the accuracy to recognize the positive or negative sentences.

The Best accuracy achieved and analyze the effect of parameters on it;
As we mentioned prior, Decreasing the Lambda and Epsilon causes the augment of the accuracy to recognize the positive or negative sentences.
